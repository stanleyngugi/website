            My Research Journey: From Self-Taught Foundations to Systematic Discovery
        </h1>

        <!-- The Beginning -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            The Beginning: Building Practical Foundations
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            After completing high school, I embarked on what would become an unconventional but deeply transformative research journey. Like many aspiring AI researchers, I began with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specializations—solid foundational courses that provided essential conceptual grounding. But it was what came next that shaped my unique approach to learning and research.
        </p>

        <!-- Reverse-Engineering Mastery -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            Reverse-Engineering Mastery: A New Learning Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            Rather than following traditional textbook-driven learning, I developed what I call a "reverse-engineering" methodology. I would identify prominent machine learning books—starting with "Hands-On Machine Learning"—but instead of reading them linearly, I would locate their GitHub repositories and dive directly into the code implementations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            My process was systematic: I would extract individual code cells from Jupyter notebooks, then engage in deep dialogue with language models to understand not just what the code did, but why it worked, how it connected to underlying theory, and when these approaches were most appropriate. Through iterative prompting and follow-up questions, I would excavate the semantic meaning behind each implementation until I achieved genuine understanding.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            This approach proved remarkably effective. By reverse-engineering implementations, I developed deep practical mastery across machine learning and deep learning engineering, gaining solid foundational exposure to natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. More importantly, I learned how to learn—how to extract deep understanding from complex technical implementations.
        </p>

        <!-- The Catalyst Project -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            The Catalyst Project: Swahili LLM Fine-Tuning
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            The pivotal moment in my research journey came through a self-imposed challenge: fine-tuning a large language model for Swahili. What began as a practical project became an intensive research bootcamp that exposed me to the frontiers of modern AI research.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            Through this project, I encountered <strong>RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), AI alignment challenges</strong>, and multilingual LLM research. While I never completed the fine-tuning as originally planned, the learning was transformational. This project served as my introduction to cutting-edge research methodologies and revealed the depth of knowledge required for serious AI research contribution.
        </p>

        <!-- The Realization -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            The Realization: From Application to First Principles
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            The Swahili project illuminated a crucial gap in my knowledge. I could implement and adapt existing techniques, but I lacked the deep theoretical foundations necessary for genuine research innovation. I needed to understand not just how to use AI tools, but why they worked, when they failed, and how to derive new approaches from first principles.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            This realization led to the most systematic phase of my learning journey: the development of what I now call "The AI Researcher's Compass."
        </p>

        <!-- Building The Foundation -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            Building The Foundation: Mathematical and Conceptual Rigor
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            I embarked on an intensive self-study program across four critical domains:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-15px">
            <li><strong>Mathematical Foundations:</strong> I went beyond computational competency to develop genuine semantic understanding of linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability theory, and information theory. My goal was not just to apply these tools but to understand their geometric meanings, their limitations, and how they fundamentally enable or constrain AI capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>System Design and Architecture:</strong> Recognizing that modern AI research requires understanding complex systems at scale, I mastered data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems design. My aspiration was to think at such a high level of abstraction that I could oversee, debug, and understand research implementations without getting lost in implementation details.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Evaluation and Debugging:</strong> I developed systematic approaches to diagnosing and solving complex problems in AI systems, treating debugging as a scientific methodology of hypothesis generation and testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Communication:</strong> I cultivated the ability to synthesize complex technical insights into compelling narratives that could influence both technical communities and broader audiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- The Emergence of Research Philosophy -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            The Emergence of Research Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            Through this systematic study, two core research philosophies crystallized that now guide all my work:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-15px">
            <li><strong>Variational Inference and Uncertainty Quantification:</strong> I developed a deep fascination with how systems reason under uncertainty, leading to several theoretical papers and blog posts. This philosophy emphasizes the importance of understanding and quantifying what our models don't know.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretability Research:</strong> Particularly mechanistic interpretability, which seeks to understand not just what neural networks do, but how they do it. This philosophy drives my commitment to building AI systems we can genuinely understand and trust.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            These are not merely research directions for me—they are foundational lenses through which I approach every research problem, ensuring that my work contributes to both capability advancement and our understanding of AI systems.
        </p>

        <!-- From Learning to Leading -->
        <h2 class="text-18px font-bold text-[#ff5e3a] mt-12 mb-6">
            From Learning to Leading: The Path Forward
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            This journey has taken me from a curious high school graduate to an active AI researcher with publications in top-tier venues. But more importantly, it has equipped me with a systematic methodology for approaching the unknown—the ability to rapidly develop deep expertise in new domains through first-principles thinking, pattern recognition across disciplines, and semantic understanding of complex systems.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            The methodologies I developed through this self-directed journey continue to evolve, but the core principles remain constant: understand deeply, question assumptions, build from first principles, and never lose sight of the broader implications of the systems we create.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-15px">
            What follows in this learning journey documentation is the systematic curriculum I developed—"The AI Researcher's Compass"—which represents not just what I learned, but how I learned to think about AI research at the deepest levels. This framework enabled me to transition from student to contributor in the global AI research community, and I believe it offers a replicable methodology for others seeking to develop uncommon expertise in this rapidly evolving field.
